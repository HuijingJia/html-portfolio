<p>
Released in October 26, 2014. Directed by Christopher Nolan.<br /> 
I have watched it more than six times. I like the pictures and the pace of the movie.<br /> 
The story is complex and I feel like collecting up some different ideas each time after I watched it!<br /> 
It shows the beauty of the universe and the music is fatastic!<br />
</p>

<h3>No.2   Dunkirk</h3>

<p>
I can feel the fear in front of the screen.<br /> 
I hate war, and thanks the movie so that I can realize how cruel the war is instead of experiencing it by real.<br /> 
As a word saying "There are no good wars and neither no bad peace!"<br /> 
</p>

<h3>NO.3   Forrest Gump</h3>

<p>
I really like the story!<br /> 
I love all the characters in the movie.<br />
Each time after I watched the movie, the character "Forest Gum" gave me strength,<br />
I can see the hope of life, and I can find some inner peace. <br />
It enables me to fight for my dreams and be a good person. <br />
